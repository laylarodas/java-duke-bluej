# 🧩 Debugging Practice — Java

This project belongs to the Duke University Java specialization and focuses on **understanding and fixing logical and runtime errors** in small Java programs.

### 🎯 Learning goals
- Identify and fix syntax and logic errors.
- Use print statements to trace variable values.
- Understand stack traces and exception causes.
- Develop a structured approach to debugging.

### 🧰 Tech
Java · BlueJ environment

### ▶️ How to run
Open the project in **BlueJ** and execute the provided methods one by one, observing console output and debugging behavior.

### 📚 Notes
This exercise helped me build the habit of reading stack traces and isolating bugs systematically before moving to larger projects.
