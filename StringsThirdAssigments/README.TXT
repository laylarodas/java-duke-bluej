# 🧬 String Third Assignments — Advanced DNA Analysis

Final string project of the Duke Java specialization.  
Focuses on **analyzing DNA data with more complex loops and conditions**.

### 🎯 Learning goals
- Combine previous logic to extract and analyze genes.
- Calculate ratios and lengths efficiently.
- Build modular methods for text pattern recognition.

### 🧰 Tech
Java · BlueJ

### ▶️ How to run
Open the project in **BlueJ** and run the `tester()` or `testProcessGenes()` method to see full analysis output.

### 📊 Typical results
- List of genes found in a DNA string.
- Statistics about GC content and gene length.
- Summary of biological pattern frequency.

### 📚 Notes
Part of the *Strings in Java* module from Duke University’s specialization.
