# 🧬 String Second Assignments — DNA Strings Practice

This project deepens the use of strings to analyze **DNA sequences** and find gene patterns.

### 🎯 Learning goals
- Work with multiple string search patterns.
- Use nested loops to locate gene start and stop codons.
- Count genes and compute GC ratios.

### 🧰 Tech
Java · BlueJ

### ▶️ How to run
Open in **BlueJ** and call the `tester()` method.  
Use sample DNA text files from the course or your own DNA strings.

### 📊 Example tasks
- Find all genes within a DNA string.
- Print genes longer than 60 characters.
- Count genes with a GC ratio higher than 0.35.

### 📚 Notes
Part of the Duke University specialization *Programming Foundations with Java*.
