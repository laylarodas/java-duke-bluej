# Java (Duke University) — BlueJ Practice Projects

A collection of **Java practice projects** developed during the Duke University course, using **BlueJ** to explore fundamental programming concepts.

These exercises focus on clean code, logical thinking, and understanding how small programs work internally — not just producing results.

## 🧩 Projects Overview

| Folder | Topics Covered |
|---------|----------------|
| **StringsFirstAssignments** | String manipulation, loops, simple methods. |
| **StringsSecondAssignments** | Pattern searching, substring extraction, text processing. |
| **StringsThirdAssignments** | File handling, counting patterns, structured methods. |
| **tagFinder1** | Finding HTML-like tags and debugging. |
| **Debugging** | Identifying and fixing logical and syntax errors. |
| **perimeter_quiz** | Geometry basics and object-oriented logic. |

Each folder is an independent BlueJ project, containing a `package.bluej` file for easy opening.
